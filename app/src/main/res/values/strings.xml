To win the battle, you must conquer the enemy\’s home planet, which is on the right side of the battlefield. However, if the enemy conquers your home planet, you lose.

    <string name="movementTask">To move your units, place your finger on the planet where you have at least one unit and drag it to the planet you want to move to. When you place your finger on the planet from which you\'re moving and move the finger, all available positions will be marked with a green circle. At the start of the battle, all planets will be marked this way, because the unique Warper unit can move anywhere. However, the remaining types of units can only move to adjacent planets.</string>
    <string name="sendShipsTask">After selecting the movement from one planet to another, you also need to choose the number of units to move.

There can be no more than 6 units per player on a planet simultaneously.</string>
    <string name="acceptableLossesTask">In addition to selecting units, you must also choose how many units you are willing to sacrifice in the battle. This is done using a slider, and the value represents the number of units. The battle itself takes place in rounds, where the units exchange shots, and it ends when one of the armies reaches its tolerated losses. When an army reaches its maximum tolerated losses, it withdraws from the battle. The withdrawn army remains on the planet, and the player can decide what to do with them in the next turn. The battle can also end in a draw if both armies reach their tolerated losses.</string>

        We are two friends united by a love for both board and computer games. Both of us started as young boys with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and later crossed paths in the online strategy game Red Dragon, to which we eventually contributed as creators. Alongside our experience as passionate players, we both developed an interest in going beyond just playing games, exploring how games are created.\n
        Our games usually begin with game mechanics, where we draw inspiration from well-known models but joyfully rewrite or adapt them into original forms. We have high standards for our games and adhere to the principle that players control the game, not the other way around. We avoid methods that unethically compete for your attention.\n\n
        Marek Basovnik\n
        Since childhood, I have been fascinated by puzzles, though I still can\’t solve a Rubik\’s Cube—I challenge myself to learn without a guide and without the cube itself. I enjoyed mathematics as a young boy and later studied theoretical physics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, where I explored the horizons of black holes. As a theoretical physicist, I realized that understanding the real world makes it easier to navigate any imaginary one, including game worlds. If you want to go from being a user to a creator, the key lies in grasping principles far deeper than you may have ever heard of.\n\n
        Marek Vachal\n
        My journey into fantasy and gaming began when I was six. At fourteen, I encountered Indian philosophy, which shaped my intellectual path. After high school, where I studied bookselling, I continued at the Faculty of Arts, specializing in Indian traditions at the Department of Comparative Study of Religions. Ironically, studying this distant culture led me to delve deeper into Western culture, showing me that the fantasy world can be far more fantastical than one might imagine.\n

    <string name="gameRulesText">
        Introduction\n
            Each game represents a single battle and is turn-based. Each round consists of two phases:\n
                1. Fleet movement of both players\n
                2. Fleet encounters\n
            Each fleet consists of spaceships, referred to as units.\n\n

        Units\n
            There are four types of units in the game:\n
                1. Cruiser\n
                    - Firepower: 1\n
                    - Shields: 10\n
                2. Destroyer\n
                    - Firepower: 2\n
                    - Shields: 10\n
                    - Ability: The total firepower of destroyers cannot exceed the number of enemy units on the battlefield.\n
                3. Ghost\n
                    - Firepower: 1\n
                    - Shields: 5\n
                    - Ability: Each Ghost disables one enemy Destroyer. The Destroyer is not destroyed but does not participate in combat as long as the Ghost is alive.\n
                4. Warper\n
                    - Firepower: 2\n
                    - Shields: 1\n
                    - Ability: Can move to any field during the movement phase.\n\n

        Movement\n
            - Each player has a total of 11 units.\n
            - Units move across fields, one field per turn, except for the Warper, which can move anywhere.\n
            - A maximum of 6 units from one player can occupy a single field, so up to 12 units (6 from each player) can be on one field.\n
            - Units on a field controlled by the enemy cannot move to another enemy-controlled field.\n
            - After both players complete their moves, the encounter phase begins.\n\n

        Fleet Encounter\n
            If units from both players are on the same field, a fleet encounter occurs. Encounters proceed in rounds.\n\n

            1. Maximum Tolerable Losses\n
                - When moving fleets, each player sets a \"maximum tolerable loss\" for the encounter. This value represents the number of units the player is willing to lose in the encounter.\n
                - The encounter ends when one player\'s fleet reaches this limit. The player who reaches their tolerable losses loses the encounter.\n\n

            2. Fleet Firepower\n
                - Fleet firepower is the sum of the firepower of all units in the fleet.\n
                - Firepower targets the unit type that is most numerous in the fleet. If there is a tie, the following priority is used:\n
                Cruiser > Destroyer > Ghost > Warper\n\n

            3. Attack\n
                - Each round, the fleet hits the enemy units, dealing damage equal to the fleet\'s firepower.\n
                - Damage is deducted from the unit\’s shields. If a unit loses all its shields, any remaining damage is transferred to the next unit according to the priority.\n
                - Destroyed units no longer contribute to the fleet\'s firepower.\n\n

            4. Firepower Reduction\n
                - Reducing the number of enemy units may decrease the fleet\’s total firepower, especially for Destroyers, whose firepower depends on the number of units on the battlefield.\n\n

        After the Encounter\n
            - After the encounter, all surviving units are restored to their maximum shield values.\n
            - If a player wins the encounter, they gain control of the field. In the case of a draw, the field remains under the control of the original owner.\n\n

        Controlled Field Bonus\n
            - A player who controls a field receives a +1 bonus to firepower in all subsequent encounters on that field.\n\n

        Victory\n
            - Each player begins on their base. If a player loses an encounter on their base field and the opponent gains control of the base, the player loses the game.

    <string name="aboutGameText">
        <b>Introduction</b>\n
        What you see today is the first step toward creating an MMORTS set in a future where humanity is capable of space travel. Each player will start with a single home planet and a few spacecraft and begin building their own stellar empire.\n\n

        <b>Current State</b>\n
        In the first phase, we are showcasing only a \“mini-game,\” which will later become part of a large building game and focuses solely on PvP combat. Our goal is to develop this part of our strategy game to the point where it stands on its own as a full-featured experience.\n
        In the game, you will choose the structure of your fleet and attempt to capture your opponent\’s base before they do the same to you. A complete player battle is estimated to last around 10 minutes. It is a turn-based strategy game, where both players plan their move, and once confirmed by both, the plans are executed simultaneously. The game includes different types of ships, each effective in various situations. Its originality lies in a unique decision-making element where players must choose when to strategically retreat or fight to the last ship.\n
        Based on your feedback, we plan to create more developed battle maps and potentially adjust some ship types according to how they are used by real players.\n\n

        <b>Future State</b>\n
        The mini-game presented here will be only a part of a larger building game, starting as an economic game. As the empire grows, it will become increasingly challenging to expand economically, and with greater size, the motivation to expand by force will increase.\n
        Our game will differ from classic online building strategy games in the following ways:\n
        - The game will contain a small number of resources, but they will be realistic commodities. Money will not just be a number generated by gold mines but will adhere to sophisticated, yet player-friendly, economic principles.\n
        - There will be no \“daily tasks\” mechanics forcing you to stay online constantly. We want to design the game so that players can return after any length of time without feeling they missed out on something. The game will encourage you to come back rather than prevent you from leaving.\n
        - The game will contain no \“pay-to-win\” concept at any level.</string>
