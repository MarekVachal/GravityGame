    <string name="numberShipsTask">For the upcoming battle, you need to select units for your army. There are four types of units. One type is the unique Warper unit, which is assigned to the army by default. Therefore, you need to choose 10 out of the remaining 11 units. Once you have assembled your army, confirm your selection with the button.</string>
    <string name="battleOverviewTitle">Battle overview</string>
    <string name="battleOverviewTask">The battle begins now. If you are playing against AI, your army is blue. Your home planet with a base is on the left side of the battlefield, where your units are also positioned. To win the battle, you must conquer the enemy\’s home planet, which is on the right side of the battlefield. However, if the enemy conquers your home planet, you lose.</string>
    <string name="movementTask">To move your units, place your finger on the planet where you have at least one unit and drag it to the planet you want to move to. When you place your finger on the planet from which you\'re moving, all available positions will be marked with a green circle. At the start of the battle, all planets will be marked this way, because the unique Warper unit can move anywhere. However, the remaining types of units can only move to adjacent planets.</string>
    <string name="sendShipsTask">After selecting the movement from one planet to another, you also need to choose the number of units to move. The first column shows the number of enemy units on the selected planet. The second column shows the number of units you can move. The third column shows the total number of units that will be on the selected planet after the move, including both the units that were there from the previous round and the units you\'re moving. There can be no more than 6 units per player on a planet simultaneously.</string>
    <string name="acceptableLossesTask">In addition to selecting units, you must also choose how many units you are willing to sacrifice in the battle. This is done using a slider, and the value represents the number of units. The battle itself takes place in rounds, where the units exchange shots, and it ends when one of the armies reaches its tolerated losses. When an army reaches its maximum tolerated losses, it withdraws from the battle. The withdrawn army remains on the planet, and the player can decide what to do with them in the next turn. The battle can also end in a draw if both armies reach their tolerated losses.</string>
    <string name="locationInfoTask">If you want to view information about a planet, click directly on it. After clicking, you will see the number of units from both armies on the selected planet. In this window, you can also change your tolerated losses at any time.</string>
    <string name="locationOwnerTask">The colour of the flag indicates the owner of the planet. If a blue flag is displayed next to the planet, it is under your control. If a battle takes place on a planet with the colour of your flag, the strength of your army is increased by 1.</string>

        We are two guys for whom games play a significant role in life. We met while playing the now-defunct online strategy game Red Dragon, and we still play various games together today. We enjoy exploring different new mechanisms that are being introduced in the gaming field, and we are not short on ideas ourselves. That’s why we decided to contribute our bit to this field as well. The development of our games always starts with their main mechanism, and as we test it, the game’s theme and any additional secondary mechanisms begin to take shape. Our goal is to bring new and original game mechanisms or unique combinations of existing ones. Last but not least, we aim to offer games that are not burdened by the pay-to-win concept and allow players to play when they want, not when the game dictates. We are people who do not want to be controlled by games, but who choose to play games in their own time.\n\n
        Marek Vachal\n
        My journey into fantasy and games began around the age of six when I started playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with my father. I have been playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, other tabletop RPGs, and board games ever since. I also play PC games, primarily building strategies, though less often than before. At the age of 14, I first encountered Indian philosophy, which subsequently shaped my intellectual interests. After high school focusing on bookseller, I enrolled at university in the Department of Comparative Study of Religions, naturally specializing in Indian traditions. Ironically, my study of a foreign culture led me back to exploring Western culture. Today, I can say that our understanding of foreign cultures is still in its early stages. In spite of it, I am already eager to share my insights with the wider public.\n\n

    <string name="gameRulesText">
        Movement\n
        - Each player has 11 units. They move units across tiles. All units except the Warper can move one tile per turn.\n
        - A maximum of 6 units per player can occupy a single tile.\n
        - A player cannot move their units onto a tile occupied by the enemy if their units are also on a tile occupied by the enemy.\n
        - A player can move all their units in one turn as long as they meet the condition of having no more than 6 units per tile.\n
        - After both players have completed their moves, the battle phase begins. If both players\' units are on the same tile, a battle ensues.\n\n
        Units\n
        - The three basic units are:\n
        - Cruiser: Firepower: 1, Shields: 10.\n
        - Destroyer: Firepower: 2, Shields: 10. Destroyers in combat can have a combined firepower no greater than the number of the opponent\'s units on the battlefield.\n
        - Ghost: Firepower: 1, Shields: 5. Each Ghost neutralizes one of the opponent\'s Destroyers from combat. The Destroyer is not destroyed but does not participate in the battle as long as the Ghost is alive.\n
        - The unique unit is:\n
        - Warper: Firepower: 2, Shields: 1. In the movement phase, it can move to any tile.\n\n
        Battle\n
        - The battle proceeds in rounds.\n
        - The armies of both players exchange attacks until one player\'s army reaches the "maximum tolerated losses," which is the number of units a player is willing to lose in the battle.\n
        - The army\'s firepower is the sum of the firepower of all units in the army.\n
        - Firepower is always focused on the type of units most represented in the army. In the case of a tie, the target is determined by priority:\n
        - Cruiser > Destroyer > Ghost > Warper\n
        - Each army hits an enemy unit each round, reducing its shields by the amount of its firepower.\n
        - If a unit loses all its shields in a given round, the excess firepower is transferred to the next unit in line according to priority in the same round. A destroyed unit no longer contributes its firepower in subsequent rounds. Similarly, if the number of enemy units decreases, there may be a reduction in firepower for Destroyers due to their firepower limit.\n
        - After a battle, any surviving but damaged units are repaired to their maximum.\n
        - If a player wins the battle on a given tile, they occupy it. In the case of a draw, the tile remains to the original owner.\n
        - On an occupied tile, the player has a +1 firepower bonus in all battles.\n\n
        Victory\n
        Each player has a base. This tile cannot be lost in any way (thus it always has a permanent +1 firepower bonus). If a player loses a battle on his base tile, he lose the game.
